Argentina Integrated Water Resources Management	Argentina	P101242	50.00	Abandonado		2013-01-15T00:00:00Z	The objective is to assist Argentina in strengthening the capacity of its federal-level and provincial-level institutions and inter-jurisdictional organizations to move forward toward integrated water resources management, in line with the guiding principles for water policy.  The proposed Project aims to assist Argentina in strengthening the capacity of its federal-level and provincial-level institutions and inter-jurisdictional organizations to move forward towards integrated water resources management, in line with the guiding principles for water policy, through: (i) formulating participatory basin water resources management plans in selected basins, (ii) establishing a national water resources monitoring system, (iii) improving water resources management information systems for strategic planning and policy making, and (iv) initiating demonstration projects (or leading models with potential for replication in other parts of the country) to promote integrated water resources management in selected basins. It is proposed the Project is financed by a specific investment loan of about US$100 million equivalent, to be disbursed over 5-6 years, and would consist of the following three components: Component A: Water Resources Monitoring and Information Systems. This component will support the following sub-components: -  Establishing a comprehensive water resources monitoring system, by developing guidelines to harmonize water monitoring across provinces/basins; setting up a national regulatory framework for water quality based on the ongoing work on guidelines on water quality (niveles guÌa de calidad de agua ambient); strengthening and upgrading data gathering capabilities of the base resource (all sources, surface water, groundwater resources, coastal waters and atmospheric interface; and all facets, quantity and quality), data transmission, and transformation of data into information to support water resources management decisions; upgrading capabilities of regional laboratory for water quality analysis; and strengthening flood forecasting and strengthening reporting capabilities. This sub-component will also assist in setting up a management approach so as to ensure the long-term sustainability of the monitoring networks, paying special attention to their operation, maintenance, budget requirements, and availability of human resources. -  Improving water resources information systems, by assisting in establishing uniform protocols for data gathering, data transmission, data storage, data retrieval and reporting capabilities of all the monitoring systems mentioned above. Protocols will include provisions to provide quality assurance and quality guaranties across the national territory. This component will also assist in setting up an integrated water resources dynamic information framework (DIF) that manages climate, land use, water, and related socio-economic data and to provide technicians and decision-makers with reliable data and information for water resources monitoring and planning and management. Component B: IWRM Institutional Capacity Building. This component will support the following sub-components: -  Strengthening planning capacity of federal and provincial level water administrations and river basin commissions with delegated planning responsibilities by assisting them in the formulation of harmonized provincial water resources management strategies and river basin management plans aimed achieving sustainable development and use of the resource base.  Preparation of basic socio-economic/environmental studies and prospective modeling studies will also be supported under this sub-component. The planning process would follow a participatory approach in dealing with cross-cutting issues and in taking into account the ecosystems and socio-economic structures of each basin. The Project will provide financial resources to support the mobilization of different actors. -  Strengthening the institutional framework of pa

Improving water supply services in these peri-urban areas is a priority for the state as it is struggling with rapidly growing population and poor water supply services in these areas.  These peri-urban areas of cities, for exa mple Dehradun, Haridwar, Rishikesh, Roorkee, Haldwani, have very low coverage of about 30% to 40% household connections for water su pply. This project will incentivize the water supply service improvement program for such rapidly expanding peri-urban areas in Utta rakhand and also show the way for such challenging areas that are increasingly part of the landscape of India and other countries.</a><br />

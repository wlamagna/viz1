The project development objective is to develop and promote a regional collaborative mechanism for the management of the Lake Basin and introduce solutions for the sustainable management of natural resources in selected priority areas in and around the lake by: (i) developing a common approach to the sustainable management of the Lake's resources; and (ii) improving livelihoods and the sustainability of fishing and farming practices in and around the Lake and critical catchments. The main target groups of the project are small and medium scale fishermen and costal communities who would benefit from improved fishing practices and diversified income opportunities and key institutions who would oversee joint lake management. The global environmental objective would be twofold: (i) to contribute to the improvement of the Lake's health by reducing pollution and increasing awareness of the fragility of the ecosystem and (ii) to improve the conservation of aquatic biodiversity of the Lake by encouraging improved fishing practices and management of lake resources. The proposed project would consist of four components to be implemented over a fsix year period at an approximate cost of US$ 52 million (US$36 million IDA/regional, US$10 million GEF and US$ 6 million Borrower).  The project would have a three tiered approach to addressing critical gaps at the institutional, community and fishery/farm level.  The project would also aim to build on experiences gained from previous Bank projects as well as other efforts during the past decade. The project would aim to combat the dual and linked problems of poverty and a deteriorating natural resource base.  Its main outcomes would be (i) the development and adoption of a regional management plan by the three riparian countries that would be the basis of the environmentally and socially sustainable utilization of coastal and lake resources, focusing on regionally agreed sharing of commercial capture fisheries and aquaculture capacity; (ii) improved fishing practices and income generation of coastal communities; and (iii) reduced nutrient inflow into the Lake.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">31000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P116533" target=_blank>The objective is to assist the participating African governments to identify and develop mineral resource corridors and to enhance benefits from the mining sector. This would include the development of regional standards to manage the sector, capacity building on a regional level, and the establishment of regional centers of excellence.  Overall project: Africa Mineral Goveranance Project (AMGP) Objectives: The long-term objective of the 10-year AMGP is to improve governments capacities to implement regional harmonization and convergence initiatives aimed at increasing sustainable benefits from mineral resource development. The higher-level objective would be to attract environmentally and socially sustainable mineral sector that is beneficial for countries and communities. This objective will be achieved by assisting African governments in implementing regional mineral development strategies, including ECOWAS Directives and Action Plan, the African Mining Vision 2050, and SADC Framework and Implementation Plan, including facilitating public-private partnership infrastructure, developing sub-regional geological information databases, and the creation of Regional/Sub-regional Centers of Excellence to enhance sector oversight and management capabilities to ensure compliance with technical, social and environemental requirements. Project description: The proposed Horizontal Adaptable Program Loan (APL) will initially be eligible to eleven countries in ECOWAS (Burkina Faso, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Guinea, Ghana, Nigeria, Niger, Mali, Senegal and Togo). The Program will stretch over ten years and each APL will have two phases. The first APL, WAMGP1 will include Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. IDA contribution to this APL will be a total of US$31.0M. Phase I of WAMGP1 will be funded in part from the IDA 15 Regional Program, and the second phase is subject to availability of IDA funds.  The project would establish a framework for lending up to US$300 million of technical assistance during FY2010-2020 for four to six regional clusters of countries following procedures for horizontal APLs.  Each cluster will consist of a minimum of three countries.  The APLs are expected to be financed through IDA country allocations (about US$100 million) combined with IDA Regional Allocation (about US$200 million).  Additional donor funding and co-financing by the governments will be sought.  Project components: (1) Good governance and mineral sector management; (2) Geological and Mining Information Systems; (3) Enabling benefits and value-addition to the local economy; and (4) Project Management.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">0</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P116805" target=_blank>The objective of the project is to strengthen COMIFAC's capacity for regional coordination of Sustainable Forest Management across the Congo Basin and to align regional program implementation to the Convergence Plan in the context of the GEF Program for the sustainable management of the forests of the Congo Basin. The objective of the Strategic Program is to strengthen sustainable management of forest ecosystems of the Congo Basin as a contribution to the conservation of the globally relevant biodiversity and ecosystem services, maintaining a solid foundation for the region's sustainable development. One of the outcomes of the Strategic Program, as stated in the Program Framework Document approved by the GEF CEO council on November 2008, consists of boosting the capacity of COMIFAC to serve as a regional coordination mechanism for (i) improved advocacy for and harmonization of sustainable forest management across the region, (ii) realization of synergies between various targeted sub-sectoral or thematic initiatives contributing to the SFM agenda, and (iii) strengthened knowledge exchange and learning processes between countries. This project falls under the larger framework of the Strategic Program for Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) in the Congo Basin. The Strategic Program for SFM presents a programmatic approach aiming to deliver multiple global environmental benefits across the Congo River ecosystem and adding value to a proposed portfolio of projects envisioned under the Strategic Program. Each of the projects that together form the portfolio of the Strategic Program for SFM in the Congo Basin presents a highly specialized and targeted entry point to sustainable forest management. By means of being under the Strategic Program, value can be added to each of the projects through realization of synergies and multiplier effects. However, coordination is critical if one wants to achieve this goal and COMIFAC SE, which is the regional entities expected to ensure this coordination, has some limitations and can not always play this coordination role. This is why the need for such an Medium-Size Project has been identified, with the aim of facilitating the information and experience sharing and fostering synergies amongst the different initiatives. This MSP project is articulated aournd four components: Comp. 1: Supporting Coordination & Communication on SFM operations in the Congo Basin under the GEF Program for the Congo Basin Comp. 2: Operationalizing COMIFAC Executive Secretariat Comp. 3: Creating knowledge on Sustainable Forest Management & Providing guidance to COMIFAC members Comp. 4: Project Management Component 1: Supporting Coordination & Communication on SFM operations in the Congo Basin The GEF Strategic Program only accounts for a dozen operations, executed by four different agencies (World Bank, UNDP, UNEP, FAO, AfDB). There are also numerous different initiatives at the regional and national level supported by the international community. The challenge to implement all these initiatives in a coordinated manner, to learn lessons from each of them and cross-fertilize is enormous. The COMIFAC SE has undoubtedly a key role to play in this coordination and is well positioned to foster knowledge sharing and dissemination amongst Congo Basin countries. The proposed component aims at supporting to COMIFAC SE in its role of coordination of the SFM operations in the Congo Basin. It will mainly rely on the following activities: (i)   Support to the communication activities: a key aspect is a smooth transfer of information and an efficient knowledge sharing amongst the different institutions in charge of SFM activities in the Congo Basin. The COMIFAC has already elaborated a communication strategy that is partially supported by the French Cooperation and the GTZ. However, some activities are still lacking resources to be properly implemented, such as the publication of the COMIFAC Brief notes, the participation to internat</a><br />

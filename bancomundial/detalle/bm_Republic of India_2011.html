The Gujarat Urban Reform Program (GURP) would seek to support the implementation of urban reforms within the State of Gujarat. These reforms would be for both State-level urban regulations, as well as at the urban local body (ULB) level.  The Government of Gujarat (GoG) has already begun implementing reforms, many identified by the Federal Government's URIF program.  Through GURP, the Government of Gujarat seeks to expand the set of reforms, and also to encourage both the implementation and sustainability of reforms at the ULB level.</a><br />

This will be achieved through development of minor irrigation (MI) schemes, strengthening community-based irrigation management, and support to agricultural development, including provision of agricultural services, encouraging crop diversification and use of new technologies, and creating income generating opportunities.</a><br />
<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">1000000000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P105991" target=_blank>The objectives are to improve: (a) the quality and sustainability of water services to inhabitants of selected Indian cities; and (b) access to water and sanitation services to un-served inhabitants in those cities, via the development of autonomous, accountable and customer-oriented service providers.  This task relates to policy lending in support of Government of India's "Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Reform Mission" (JNNURM) reform and investment programme. The proposed lending would support policy and institutional reforms at the State level, as these states shift away from direct top-down involvement in the management and financing of urban centres and towards an oversight and policy role, as local governments assume greater autonomy and accountability for local governance, service delivery and infrastructure.</a><br />

<b></b>&nbsp;<font color="red">7980000</font>&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.bancomundial.org/es/projects-operations/project-detail/P124354" target=_blank>The proposed additional financing from GEF of US$7.49 million aims at scaling-up and mainstreaming the outcome of the activities under Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed Management Project (UDWDP) and ultimately enhancing their sustainability by restoring and sustaining ecosystem functions and biodiversity while simultaneously enhancing income and livelihood functions, and generating lessons learned in these respects that can be up-scaled and mainstreamed at state and national levels.    This objective is fully consistent with the original objective of the UDWDP. The GEF project is fully integrated in the World Bank supported Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed Development Project (UDWDP) that in turn draws on the positive experiences from the Integrated Watershed Development Hills-II project that was completed in 2005. The UDWDP is consistent with the World Bankâs Country Assistance Strategy that has a priority to "support better management of watersheds, while enhancing the livelihood opportunities of the poor". The project focuses on protection of watersheds, along with community-level capacity building and promotion of livelihoods. The project is spread over an area of around 238,000 ha, ranging from 700 m to 2000 m altitude in 76 selected micro watersheds in the middle Himalayas. About 451 Gram Panchayats (GP) identified in 18 blocks of 11 districts will participate in this project. A total population of 254,000, living in the project area will benefit from these activities. Activities financed by additional financing will focus on 20 micro watersheds that have high erosion indices, which are left behind in terms of socio-economic and other criteria and are predominantly situated close to the agricultural frontier. With this targeted approach on the most vulnerable areas, the impact of the project will be positive both in socio-economic and environmental terms. The outcome of the additional financing project will be measured against the following performance indicators: (i) Sustainable Watershed Management mainstreamed into 20 local government plans including parts of watersheds for which two or more Gram Panchayats have shared governance responsibility; (ii) Implementation of alternative technologies and approaches for enhancing water availability for agriculture and other domestic use; (iii) reduction in community dependency of forest for fuel wood and entering markets with medicinal and aromatic plants; (iv) improved knowledge of the impact of climate change on mountain ecosystems translated into coping strategies; (v) new and innovative techniques and approaches for sustainable land an ecosystem management up-scaled within the Uttarakhand state. Performance will be monitored periodically through well defined indicators by external specialists.</a><br />
